#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Design an app that simplifies everyday life by combining innovation, user-friendliness, and real-world impact. Imagine an app that not only solves a common problem but also enhances the user’s experience in a meaningful way.   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create this new file to generate the app logo.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

The app should allow users to play a game where they can ‘train’ an AI, understand its decision-making process, and explore how AI learns and evolves. The game should be simple, intuitive, and visually appealing, with a focus on teaching the basics of machine learning, neural networks, and data patterns in a fun and interactive way. The app should include features such as:
AI Training Mode: Users can input data, label it, and watch the AI learn from it.
Game Challenges: Users compete or collaborate to train AI to solve puzzles, recognize patterns, or make decisions.
AI Personality Customization: Users can create and customize AI characters with different learning styles and behaviors.
Educational Content: Include short, engaging lessons and explanations about AI concepts.
Multiplayer Mode: Allow users to play together, train AI collaboratively, or compete in AI-based challenges.
Progress Tracking: Users can track their AI’s performance and see how it improves over time.
Accessibility: Ensure the app is easy to use for all ages and abilities, with clear instructions and visual feedback.

The following files in your repository are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to implement the new AI‑training game features you described:

```
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
mini-app/app/page.tsx
mini-app/components/ai-training.tsx
mini-app/components/game-challenges.tsx
mini-app/components/ai-personality.tsx
mini-app/components/educational-content.tsx
mini-app/components/multiplayer.tsx
mini-app/components/progress-tracking.tsx
```

Please add any of these files to the chat that you want me to edit or create, and I’ll provide the appropriate *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
